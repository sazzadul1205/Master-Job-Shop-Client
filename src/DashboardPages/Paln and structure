### General Layout Suggestions:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Show role-specific metrics, recent activity (e.g., job applications, gig bids, upcoming events, etc.).
2. **Sidebar Menu**: Provide a collapsible sidebar with role-based menu items.
3. **Role Switcher (Optional)**: If users can have multiple roles (e.g., company and mentor), allow switching roles from the dashboard.

This setup ensures that each role has access to the right pages without overlapping functionality. For instance, job seekers won’t have access to job management features, while companies won't see mentorship-specific pages unless they're registered as mentors too.
